  <h1>Hitotsumi-Sama</h1>
  <p>  Once uphon a time There was a lone boy named Atsuki. He was raised in the ghetto area of tokyo in the 1990s. When he was ten he encountered a one eyed monster named Hitotsumi-sama,"What are you sir" The child asked curiously. He only responded with "zangi". The child asked, "what is a zangi"? He didn't respond, and left. Now twenty-two years later Atsuki has a good job in witch he hates at Mitsukoshi Ginza a high end department store in downtown Tokyo. While working Hitotsumi just appeared after twenty-two years. "Hitotsumi? How long has it been"? He asked. "Twenty-two years, and it seems as if you are going through a crisis"."NO! No, I'm not" He yells. "Look stop, you know you are, please let me help you". Hitotsumi said bluntly. "Ok". "You and I know you hate you're job, so let's start there." And so with only a few months Atsuki quit his job and moved to sapparo and now works in a raman shop. THE END </p>
